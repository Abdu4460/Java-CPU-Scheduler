# Java-Shortest-Job-First-Scheduler
This is an implementation of the Shortest Job First (SJF) process scheduling algorithm done for the group project for my Operating Systems course.</br> I am working on this using many internet sources to help like geeksforgeeks, stack overflow, javapoint, etc. and also using the source code provided with the book: Operating Systems Concepts by Gagne et al.
